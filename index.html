    <h1>KSJ Vardhan's Component Library</h1>
    <p>I am attending neog.camp and currently completing levelZero</p>
    <p>This is a component library created by me to better design each element</p>
    <p>After creating this library I am going to use the components in my <strong>portfolio, blog and all projects</strong> created. This will ensure that all my projects have consistent styling.</p>
